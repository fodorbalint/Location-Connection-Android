1.6.1 - 26 June 2020

Bug fix: image on the registration page cannot be edited if you opened it after this sequence of events: registration page -> pressing home button -> opening app -> opening a profile -> back to main view --> registration page.

1.6 - 25 June 2020

Improvements:
- When rearranging pictures on the registration/profile edit page, a shadow will mark where the picture will be dropped.
- When receiving notification of a new match/unmatch/rematch, the relation status will be updated in the list that is already loaded in tile view or profile view, even if you are seeing another profile.

Bug fixes:
- Large resolution images of some phones cannot be uploaded.
- When uploading square images and leaving the registration/profile edit page, upon returning the image uploads again.
- When clicking on a location update notification, and then on the profile page clicking on the chat button, the previous page opens instead of the chat window.
- When clicking on a message notification from a profile page that was opened from a chat, and then you get unmatched, the page you are going back to does not reflect the status change. The profile remains after unmatching or blocking too.
- Background location updates do not work in all systems under all circumstances. This feature is now removed, just like in the iOS version of the app.
- The list of users appears to load twice in some circumstances.
- After switching location off on the profile edit page, upon returning to the main view, all people appear. If distance filtering was on with current location and map view, the map remains as it was instead of switching to the other location.
- Clicking on current location when either location permission is not granted or profile location is off, results in the list not being refreshed after you enable the features.
- With device location permission off, but on in the profile, if you filter by other location with map view, and choose "No location filter", the map remains.
- If you leave the app to turn off revoke location permission for the app, upon returning the app shows you are still filtering by current location.

1.5 - 17 June 2020

Bug fixes:
- On the profile edit page photo uploading crashes the app if distance filtering for other location was not set.
- Image uploading issues, especially for photos selected from a cloud service, or on Android 7.1.1, where the app may run out of memory.
- The distance slider gets highlighted unnecessarily when pressing anywhere in its containing box.
- If you set address/coordinates while being logged in, and it was not set on your logged out page, this does not disappear after logging out.

1.4 - 30 May 2020

Bug fixes:
- The system navigation bar covers the bottom of page in profile view.
- Photo uploading errors, and on some phones (including LG G5 and Samsung A71), portrait photos appear in landscape orientation in the editor.
- When selecting a photo with the keyboard open, the photo will appear smaller than the cutting frame.
- On own profile, report/block menu appears, and results in crash when selected.
- If on the registration page the description text contains ;, upon leaving the page and returning to it, the text will be cut off.
- It is possible to click Images button twice.
- When unchecking location/distance sharing with friends, the "No one" option does not get checked.
- When rearranging pictures on the registration/profile edit page, they get invisible outside the dragging area.
- If device orientation changes on the main page, when viewing a profile the image will be shorter than normal or have extra space above and below.
- Delete account section remains open after deleting account and logging in with another user
- In some situations the back button on the profile page covers the name and the username.
- In a certain situation an empty space appears in place of the distance filters.
- If distance filtering is selected by current location, but location permission is not granted, and in the user account location is on, after rejecting the request the user preference will be turned off, but when you log out and in again, the preference is still on.

1.3 - 15 May 2020

An image editor was created for cropping pictures before uploading, and a tutorial added to the help center.

Bug fixes:
- Pressing the like and hide buttons repeatedly results in error.
- The app crashes when on the register page you long-tap the empty space next to the one uploaded picture.
- Blocking a user from their profile page which was opened from the chat results in a crash.
- Chat list pictures (if they weren't visible in the last 24 hours) do not load fully, and wrong picture is shown at the first chat.
- Texts containing certain characters do not display correctly.
- When stepping back from profile edit page with the keyboard open with location being turned off, introduction text does not align to the bottom.
- On a profile page, scrolling the pictures by dragging them does not immediately update the status indicator circles.

1.2 - 7 April 2020

Block/report feature have been added.

Furthermore, the following bugs have been fixed:

- In a chat window a new message appears even if it is from another match.
- If you receive a notification of a new message, and click on it, the keyboard does not hide if it was visible.
- Occasional crash when stepping back from the chat window to chat list.
- First incoming message does not show up in chat list. 
- When you change search distance radius, users that are now out of range remain on the map.
- When a message appears that no location was set, it does not disappear automatically once it is set.
- If you enter an invalid address, and then reload the list, the address is not reverted back to the previous valid value.
- When you are logged in at program start, changing the list type for the first time may not work.
- Android 6 crash on startup
- When a logged in user who has location enabled, but turned it off in their profile, clicks on the map icon, a message appears that "Location was not set or acquired", and the map is not shown.
- If device location is enabled, but disabled in your account, and you are filtering by distance from a given coordinate/address, but now want to use own location, the list is not refreshed.
- It is possible to delete uploaded pictures one after another too fast, which results incorrect view.
