/*
 Used when opening ProfileViewActivity.
 When using ActivityFlags.ReorderToFront, the activity will still have its previous intent, which will cause malfunction if we open:
 List -> ProfileView -> ChatOne -> ProfileView
 ClearTop calls OnCreate
 SingleTop calls OnCreate, and creates multiple instances of the activity we pressed back from.
 ReorderToFront calls OnCreate only if activity does not exist in the back stack.
